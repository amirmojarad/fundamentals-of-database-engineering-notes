# Savepoints
Savepoints are a feature in transactional databases like PostgreSQL that allow you to create intermediate points within a transaction to which you can roll back without affecting the entire transaction. This can be particularly useful for complex transactions where partial rollbacks might be necessary.

**What Are Savepoints?**
A savepoint is a named point within a transaction that you can use to roll back part of the transaction without aborting the entire transaction. Once a savepoint is created, you can perform multiple operations and, if necessary, roll back to that savepoint to undo those operations while preserving other changes made in the transaction.

## Use Cases for Savepoints

**Complex Transactions** In a transaction with multiple steps, where each step depends on the success of previous steps, savepoints allow partial rollbacks. This is particularly useful in large applications with multiple conditional operations.

**Error Handling** When an error occurs during a transaction, you might not want to roll back the entire transaction but only the part that failed. Savepoints provide a way to handle errors gracefully and maintain the consistency of other operations within the same transaction.

**Batch Processing** When processing batches of data, savepoints allow you to roll back only the failed batch while committing successful batches.

**Nested Transactions Simulation** Savepoints can be used to simulate nested transactions, providing finer control over transaction management within a larger transaction
